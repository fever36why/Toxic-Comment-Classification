This project aims to improve online conversation in an intelligent way, by detecting different types of toxicity (threats, obscenity, insults and hate) from a dataset of comments from Wikipedia’s talk page edits.

•	Comments statistics profiling
•	Comments topic feature vectors
•	Word embedding with GLoVe and fastText

1.	Word-level Detection Model with Bidirectional GRU layer
2.	Word-level Detection Model with CNN layer
3.	Character-level Detection Model with LSTM layer

An accurate stacked model with AUC of 0.98, can precisely identify toxic comments and the toxicity types.
